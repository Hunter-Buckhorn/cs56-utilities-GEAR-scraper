Lab 05 for Domenic Dipeppe (drdipepperjr) and Alex Thielk (athielk).

(a) Description:

The program scrapes the GEAR catalog for course names and corresponding GE requirements from a PDF. It then puts this information into an ArrayList. There is an option for a GUI.

(b) User stories:

As a student, I can select GE's so that I can find possible classes.
As a counselor, I can select GE's so that I can recommend classes to students.
As a student, I can select multiple GE's so that I can take classes that fulfill multiple requirements.

(c) Software Assessment:

The software runs very well. It scrapes the 2012-2013 GEAR PDF and it provides the user with a menu. On the menu, you can select GE's that you want (and even multiple GE's). The system then shows you a list of all possible courses that match your search parameters.

(d) Possible use cases: 
As a student, I want a search bar so that I can find courses that contain certain keywords.
As an engineering student, I want to be able to select my major so I can find major classes. 

(e) README.MD:

Needs to be updated to include the PDF for the current year.
Should tell the user that the URL needs to be updated every year.

(f) build.xml

All targets have descriptions. 
None of the targets are out-of-date.

(g) Issues

The only issue is updating the the URl to match the one from this year.
This is not enough work to do to receive 1000 points.

(h) Other Issues

There are no other issues, only more features that could be added

(i) Code Assessment

Code is well organized and commented out. It's very easy to understand what each line of code does.
For example, he puts all of the if statements in giant blocks so that you can easilty find them. 
He also comments the purpose of each of the if statements.
All of the methods are well defined and have understandable names. All methods have comments describing what their purpose is.

The relations between the classes are very clear. 
GECourse implements CoEgeCourse. 
GEARScraper.java makes an instance of GECourse and calls its constructor so that it can be added to an ArrayList.
PDFTextParser is obviously the class that defines how to scrape a PDF.
The purposes of the GUI classes are easy to understand as well.

The only class that had code that was hard to understand was PDFTextParser. However, there is a comment in the README that gives a URL to the library that he used.
The class GECourse is well organized and all of its member variables are easy to understand.
GECourse is the class you want to look at if you want to understand this code. 

(j) Test Coverage
There are a few JUnit test cases that only test parsing of PDF's that include odd symbols and words.
There is nothing to test that the GEARScraper actually returns the correct course information. 

We would write test cases that test the GEARScraper and test that the GECourses created are the correct ones.
